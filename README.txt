Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello! Before you start playing this game, there are some things you need to know.
This game uses the following libraries: pygame,random, pygame_functions
If you don't have or don't want to download those libraries, you can still play using the .exe file.

You can see that there are 2 languages for this game. English and Portuguese. Each one will have it's own .exe file inside the folder "*(language)* exe" with the name "run_game.exe". Portuguese is my main language, so sorry for my bad english!

How-to-play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is simple: use the arrow keys to select your option and the return to confirm... The menu and "work" area you need to use the mouse to click your option!
There are no right or wrong choices, it's just what you want or don't want to do!

About the game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game talks about living with depression. I used my own experience and tried to reproduce it as accurate as I feel sometimes... With that in mind, other people with depression can feel really diferent than what the game reproduce. You shouldn't use this as a way to understand depression or other mental illness... but it can help a little to start understand and be open mind when hearing someone talking about those things!

Sometimes, some people just need to be heard. Sometimes they just want to be on their own and do their own things. We can never guess what exactly is going on, but in this game I couldn't use all those things, so it's just a week resuming everything I could think of this mental illness. I hope you enjoy the gameplay and, the most important thing:


IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT NEEDS HELP, CALL FOR HELP.
IT'S NOT DRAMA, IT'S NOT LAZINESS, IT'S NOT BE A BUM. IT'S SOMETHING SERIOUS AND A LIFE COULD BE IN RISK.

Talk about it, don't pretend it doesn't exist and don't use it to bully others. People need to know about it, need to know what to do and that they will be ok!
